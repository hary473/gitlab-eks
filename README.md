To integrate GitLab with an EKS cluster, you can use the GitLab managed Kubernetes integration, which automatically sets up and manages a Kubernetes cluster within your GitLab project. Here are the high-level steps for the integration:

Create an EKS cluster using Terraform: You can use the terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws module to create the EKS cluster.

Create a GitLab project and enable Kubernetes integration: Go to your GitLab project, navigate to the "Operations" section, and enable the Kubernetes integration. You will need to provide the cluster credentials and select the cluster from the list of available clusters.

Deploy GitLab Runner: GitLab Runner is used to run CI/CD jobs in the Kubernetes cluster. You can deploy GitLab Runner using Terraform and the gitlab-runner Helm chart.

Monitor the EKS cluster with Grafana: To monitor the cluster, you can set up Grafana, a popular open-source monitoring and analytics platform. You can use Terraform to deploy Grafana and the required components (e.g., Prometheus, Alertmanager).

Here is an example Terraform code that automates the whole infrastructure:
